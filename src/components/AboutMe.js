            <h3>Amanda Barlow is a Software Engineer and Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor who has worked in the public mental health profession since graduating with her Master's is Professional Counseling in 2006.  Amanda has enjoyed working with clients who have a history of childhood or military trauma.  During her time in the field, she noticed that there was some disparity between systems created for the medical health providers and the mental health providers.  Mental health providers were often given a system created for the medical provider and then "adapted" for the mental health field.  These systems were difficult to navigate and did not always meet the specific needs of the mental health field.  Amanda decided to learn more about how to code these programs with the hope of one day being able to help the counseling field become more person centered through having a better user experience.  This application is born from that vision.  Please feel free to provide feedback by filling out the contact form below.  </h3>

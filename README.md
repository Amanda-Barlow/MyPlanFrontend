# Your Treatment, Your Plan

A full stack application developed using the MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, and Node.js) stack. Your Treatment, Your Plan adhered to the MVC (Models, Views and Controllers) file structure on the backend.  Developers applied full CRUD to the form page. The site pulls from the data created by the user and saves this information to MongoDB Atlas. The application is deployed using Heroku.

This is an application designed to improve the treatment planning process for clients and professionals while still meeting requirements of insurance providers. This application allows client users to input their own information and then allows the therapist to review the information use this information along with clinical revisions to create a truely individualized treatment plan for every user. This also increases ownership of treatment for the client which is shown to improve outcomes. 

Approach Taken: 
    Developer created a backend and frontend repository using github. Developer then created a Trello application to track progress of the project.  Next the basic application was developed and frontend and backend were connected.  Developer then used historical knowledge to create a treatment plan form to be filled out by the user, added PHQ9 and GAD7 assessments to the page.  Each of these items were placed in their own components and then referenced on the forms page.  This allowed the application to be dynamic.  
    
In development: 
    Given more time, development team would like to add:
      1. User authorization and the ability to save your own plan.
